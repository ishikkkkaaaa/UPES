Q implement the simple linear regression from the scratch  without using any library fuction. Use the concept of variance and covariance of data points to find the required parameters

## Linear regression
Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship
between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more
explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one
explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than
one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression
â€¢
In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor
functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the
data. Such models are called
linear models. Most commonly, the
conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory
variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine function of those
values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is
used.
